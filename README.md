# azdo-branch-name-generator-extension

## Disclaimer

The code used in this extension, is an ugly spaghetti vanilla javascript code.  
If i would write it again, I would probably use React to acheive a more modular and reusable code.  
This is the first exension I wrote, and only by the end i was noticed that it could be made with React.  
but, as it would probably not be maintained, i decided to keep it this way... until i decide to re write it :)
